# **Camp Awesomesauce**

### Welcome to the Camp Awesomesauce App Client. 
You can use this app to make and manage packlists for your next burn. You can create an account, add some profile information, and find resources to ensure next year was better. 

You can find the deployed project [here](https://campawesomesauce.herokuapp.com/).
It pairs with the server side, found [here](https://github.com/adventurernav/CampAwesomesauce).

### Cloning this project
Navigate to where you want the project cloned to in the command line. The client and server are seperate repos, so I suggest making a new folder. Let's make a few commands:
$ git clone https://github.com/adventurernav/CampAwesomesauce
$ npm i
$ npm start

Be sure to check out the readme on the server app if you want to clone that as well. 
For Demo purposes, I have the server already running.
